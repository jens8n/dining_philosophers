# philosophers

Simulation of the dining philosophers problem implemented in POSIX threads.

"The dining philosopher problem,
in the case of only having one philosopher,
is that it cannot eat, think, or sleep, 
but to wait for its natural path in life.
I find relatability in that, of which
both the philosopher and I are just
waiting for our inevitable death."
